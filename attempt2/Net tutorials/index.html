                Welcome to the CyberTutor. Our websiteâ€™s goal is to educate people regardless of their economic and social background from around the world using the internet. We aim to provide resources to learn for free by providing general videos and text to cover various topics from high school. We use the knowledge learned from school like Algebra and Precalculus and from the internet like Cyber Security to pass it on to other people. We believe that the internet is a place to learn more information without having to pay for resources and that this website is one of them to learn.
